## Synopsis
Welcome to an automated way of setting and changing your background with Python. This currently has only been tested on Windows 10. If you would like to automate this process, you can use schtasks on the cmd line.

## Motivation

I created this as an effort to become more acquainted with python, and do something that seems fun.

## Installation

First install the required packages:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Use the python 3 compiler and run change_background.py

## Tests

Will be added later.
